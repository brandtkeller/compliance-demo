# 2024 Annual - WIP

## Q1 - Foundations & Discovery:

* Release: an initial version of Lula released to enable teams to begin development of validations. Establish process for future releases to follow.
* CI/CD: Establish supported workflows for CI/CD. Structure (Lint) → Assess (validate) → Compare (evaluate)
* Validation Discovery: Create component definition artifacts for use on a variety of apps
* Document: Build and improve documentation to support tool-use with other conceptual patterns required for secure systems.

## Q2 Provenance:

* Provenance: Continue to iterate on improving the provenance of artifacts that Lula can process/produce.
* Reporting: Development of procedures to produce CLI & Graphical reporting (% controls fully satisfied/ partially satisfied/not-satisfied)
* Artifact Generation: Enable shifting context between OSCAL model artifacts where available to accelerate production of accreditation artifacts. Provide reproducible process. 

## Q3 Data Sources:

* Risk Management Framework: Improve RMF provenance through enhanced context. Augment catalogs/profiles to include identifiers we find valuable. 
* Advocate: Present Lula intent in venues small (demo) and large (virtual/in-person) events to garner attention and feedback for value to the ecosystem.
* Data Collection: Increase domain data collection methods by 1 to enable greater compliance mapping capabilities 

## Q4 Integration:

* Request Feedback: Engage with ecosystems (OSCAL, OPA, CNCF, OpenSSF) to get feedback on critical workflows or logic that can be improved.
* Benchmark: Provide component definition artifacts for various benchmarks/best-practices (CIS etc)
* Cyber Tooling: Expand domain surface to include data collection from known cyber tools
