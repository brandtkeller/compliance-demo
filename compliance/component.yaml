                a. Identify the types of events that the system is capable of logging in support of the audit function: [Assignment: organization-defined event types];
                b. Coordinate the event logging function with other organizational entities requiring audit-related information to guide and inform the selection criteria for events to be logged;
                c. Specify the following event types for logging within the system: [Assignment: organization-defined organization-defined event types (subset of the event types defined in [AU-2a.](#au-2_smt.a)) along with the frequency of (or situation requiring) logging for each identified event type];
                d. Provide a rationale for why the event types selected for logging are deemed to be adequate to support after-the-fact investigations of incidents; and
                e. Review and update the event types selected for logging [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].
