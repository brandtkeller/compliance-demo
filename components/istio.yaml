          # Control Description
            Access control policies (e.g., identity-based policies, role-based policies, control matrices, cryptography) control access between active entities or subjects (i.e., users or processes acting on behalf of users) and passive entities or objects (e.g., devices, files, records, domains) in information systems. 
            In addition to enforcing authorized access at the information system level and recognizing that information systems can host many applications and services in support of organizational missions and business operations, access enforcement mechanisms can also be employed at the application and service level to provide increased information security.

          # Control Implementation
            Istio implements with global configuration.

          # How Istio Helps
            Istio helps implement access enforcement in two ways: limiting service-to-service access (see AC-4 below),
            and acting as an enforcement point for end user authentication and authorization (AC-3, this section).
            - Service to Service Access: Istio provides authenticatable runtime identities for all applications in the mesh in the form of X.509 certificates.
            Those certificates are used for encryption in transit as well as authentication of the service's identity.
            This authenticated principal can be used for access control of service to service communication via Istio's AuthorizationPolicy.
            We cover this in detail in AC-4, Information Flow Enforcement, below.
            - End User Authentication and Authorization: Istio facilitates end user authentication and authorization in two ways:
            1. Istio has native support for JWT authentication and authorization based on JWT claims.
               It can be configured to extract a JWT from each request's headers, validate them against issuers and with specific keys, and limit access based on any of the JWT's fields.
            2. Istio supports extracting metadata from each request and forwarding it to an external authentication and authorization server.
               Istio will enforce the verdict returned by this server, and can attach additional metadata returned by the server (e.g., an internal JWT in place of an external API key). 
        remarks: This control is partially implemented by this tool.

          # Control Description
            Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel within an information system and between information systems (as opposed to who is allowed to access the information) and without explicit regard to subsequent accesses to that information. 
            Flow control restrictions include, for example, keeping export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, blocking outside traffic that claims to be from within the organization, restricting web requests to the Internet that are not from the internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers between organizations based on data structures and content. 

          # Control Implementation
            Istio implements with mission team configuration.

          # How does Istio help?
            Istio encrypts all in-mesh communication at runtime using the service's identity. 
            This provides TLS for all applications in the mesh. If you're using the Tetrate Istio Distribution, then this TLS is FIPS verified. mTLS is configured through the PeerAuthentication resource, and should be set to STRICT to enforce mTLS between all components of the information system.
            Istio's AuthorizationPolicy controls service-to-service communication within the mesh. 
            Combined with Istio ingress and egress gateways, as well as a few installation settings, Istio can manage all traffic into and out of your deployment.
            In addition to AuthorizationPolicies controlling traffic in the mesh, Istio ingress gateways terminate HTTPS on behalf of applications in the mesh (AC-4 (4) - not required by moderate but valuable nonetheless). 
            By managing how traffic flows out of applications using VirtualServices or ServiceEntries, all traffic leaving your infrastructure can be channeled through an egress gateway. 
            Egress gateways can audit and limit how traffic flows to external services outside of the information system under control.
        remarks: This control is fully implemented by this tool.

          # How does Istio help?
            When Istio is configured as above for AC-4 limiting access to services within the information system and controlling communication ingress and egress to and from the information system it provides logical separation of information flows. 
            Istio policies can provide this separation at the finest grain possible. For example, for HTTP traffic, Istio provides the ability to limit communication per verb and path, as well as based on header values or end-user credentials stored at headers, in addition to controlling traffic with the traditional network five-tuple. 
            Istio enforces the policy at the application instance itself.
        remarks: This control is partially implemented by this tool, this would be handled by integration with authservice or other similar integration.

          # Control Description
            Network access is any access across a network connection in lieu of local access (i.e., user being physically present at the device).
            The organization authorizes network access to organization-defined privileged commands only for organization-defined compelling operational needs and documents the rationale for such access in the security plan for the information system.

          # Control Implementation
            Configured with an "admin" gateway to restrict access to applications that only need sysadmin access.

          # Control Description
            Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by authorized users, or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised information system accounts, is a serious and ongoing concern and can have significant adverse impacts on organizations. 
            Auditing the use of privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse, and in doing so, help mitigate the risk from insider threats and the advanced persistent threat (APT).

          # Control Implementation
            Istio implements with global configuration.

          # How does Istio help?
            Istio produces logs for all traffic in the information system see AU-3 below for more information on what information is logged and how to configure additional information to be logged with each access. 
            As long as the privileged functions are exposed as network endpoints in the information system, Istio will log their use like it logs all other network traffic.
            Logging privileged use outside of the information system like using kubectl to access the cluster directly is outside of the scope of Istio's runtime logging.
        remarks: This control is partially implemented by this tool, with the requisite privileged functions being required as exposed as network endpoints when applicable. Administrative gateways that expose these privileged endpoints would be required.

            This control addresses situations in which organizations determine that no identification or authentication is required in organizational information systems. 
            Organizations may allow a limited number of user actions without identification or authentication including, for example, when individuals access public websites or other publicly accessible federal information systems, when individuals use mobile phones to receive calls, or when facsimiles are received.

            Limiting the number of access control points for remote accesses reduces the attack surface for organizations. Organizations consider the Trusted Internet Connections (TIC) initiative requirements for external network connections.
            The information system routes all remote accesses through organization-defined number managed network access control points.

          # Control Description
            An event is any observable occurrence in an organizational information system. 
            Organizations identify audit events as those events which are significant and relevant to the security of information systems and the environments in which those systems operate in order to meet specific and ongoing audit needs. 
            Audit events can include, for example, password changes, failed logons, or failed accesses related to information systems, administrative privilege usage, PIV credential usage, or third-party credential usage. 
            In determining the set of auditable events, organizations consider the auditing appropriate for each of the security controls to be implemented. 
            To balance auditing requirements with other information system needs, this control also requires identifying that subset of auditable events that are audited at a given point in time.

          # Control Implementation
            Istio routes remote access through correct configuration and managed network access control points.
        remarks: This control is fuly implemented by this tool, from Istio context if logging is not set to "none".

            Event outcomes can include indicators of event success or failure and event-specific results (e.g., the security state of the information system after the event occurred).

          # Control Implementation
            Istio implements with global configuration.

          # How does Istio help?
            Istio generates access logs for all traffic in the mesh (ingress, internal, and egress) that is a superset of the data in the [Common Log Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Log_Format). 
            For HTTP traffic, this includes timestamp, source and destination IPs, request verb, response code, and more. 
            You can get a full overview of the data that is provided [in the Istio documentation](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/observability/logs/access-log/). 
            The format of these logs can be configured per deployment or globally at install time to conform with requirements of existing log analysis tools or other organizational needs.
            By default, Envoy sidecars in the mesh emit these logs as text to standard out. However, Envoy can be configured to forward this log data over gRPC to a server that aggregates (and potentially acts on) them. 
            This is called the [Access Log Service (ALS)](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/service/accesslog/v3/als.proto).
            These can be augmented by application-specific audit logging, but for many services (and HTTP services especially), the mesh's logs are sufficient to reconstruct an understanding of events to perform an audit.
        remarks: This control is fuly implemented by this tool.

            Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit settings, and audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system activity. 
            This control focuses on technical protection of audit information. 
            Physical protection of audit information is addressed by media protection controls and physical and environmental protection controls.

          # Control Implementation
            Istio contributes but does not implement.

          # How does Istio Help?
            If you’re using Istio to produce audit information (see AU-3, AU-3 (1)), then the logs that Istio produces are subject to AU-9 controls. 
            Protecting the logs that Istio produces is outside of the scope of Istio itself, but integrating your log ingestion and protection system with the logs that Istio produces, you can easily satisfy this requirement.
            Kubernetes RBAC should be configured to allow only specific users access to the log files Envoy produces, ideally no users should have direct access and instead only access logs via the log ingestion system (like Splunk).

            Audit records can be generated from many different information system components. 
            The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be generated. 
            These events are typically a subset of all events for which the information system is capable of generating audit records.

            Istio implements with global configuration.

          # How does Istio Help?
            Istio generates logs for all network traffic - TCP connections, HTTP requests, etc. These events are a subset of all events defined by most organizations in AU-2 a. as worthy of audit. 
            See AU-3 for details of the information that can be generated, and AU-3 (1) for information on customizing it.
            If the only events to be logged per AU-2 a. are network events, then Istio satisfies AU-12 fully for the information system.

            Any changes to the hardware, software, and/or firmware components of information systems can potentially have significant effects on the overall security of the systems. 
            Therefore, organizations permit only qualified and authorized individuals to access information systems for purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications. 
            Organizations maintain records of access to ensure that configuration change control is implemented and to support after-the-fact actions should organizations discover any unauthorized changes.

            Istio is configured with Kubernetes Custom resources. As such it can be configured as code, and managed by your existing CM-5 conformant code management processes. 
            Kubernetes RBAC should be used to control who can change which configuration at runtime.
            BigBang implements CM-5 controls by implementing infrastructure as code practices, configuring Kubernetes RBAC to prevent humans from authoring configuration and allowing only continuous delivery systems (Flux, by default) to author runtime configuration. 
            Since all configuration is managed in this CM-5 conformant way, Istio’s configuration is controlled in a CM-5 conformant way.

            Istio’s service inventory is updated continuously from the Kubernetes API server (the information system’s source of truth for what applications are running). 
            Therefore, the inventory is updated when components of the information system are installed or removed. As a result, Istio implements CM-8 (1) for the information system.

          # Control Description
            Organizations maintain information system inventories to the extent feasible. Virtual machines, for example, can be difficult to monitor because such machines are not visible to the network when not in use. 
            In such cases, organizations maintain as up-to-date, complete, and accurate an inventory as is deemed reasonable. 
            This control enhancement can be satisfied by the implementation of CM-2 (2) for organizations that choose to combine information system component inventory and baseline configuration activities.
            The organization employs automated mechanisms to help maintain an up-to-date, complete, accurate, and readily available inventory of information system components.

            Istio can be used to implement authentication of end-user credentials for applications in the mesh. This is typically configured via Istio’s external authorization service or by validating JWTs on each request (see AC-3).
            If components in the information system are protected by Istio configured to validate end-user credentials, then Istio satisfies the authentication clause IA-2: “[the information system] authenticates organizational users (or processes acting on behalf or organizational users).” 
            Assigning user identities themselves, and ensuring their uniqueness, is out of scope of Istio. (Istio does assign identities to applications or processes running in the information system see AC-4.)

            Istio assigned identities to runtime entities based on their Kubernetes service account. Service accounts are unique per (namespace, service account name) pair and are assigned to all pods in the cluster. 
            Pods should opt in to using a specific service account, but if they do not then Kubernetes provides a default service account per namespace.
            The identities Istio assigned are:
              a. Authorized for the specific application by checking against the Kubernetes API server (the system of record for runtime identities).
              b. Each service receives an identity from Kubernetes at runtime, whether it is assigned explicitly or not.
              c. Sent only to correct workloads because Istio authenticates runtime proofs (mainly, the pod’s service account token) in addition to authorizing the identity by checking with the Kubernetes API server.
              d. Service accounts in Kubernetes are unique. However, Kubernetes-level controls (out of the scope of Istio) need to be implemented to ensure that identities are not re-used.
              e. The Kubernetes service account lifecycle is out of scope of Istio. A Kubernetes-level control is need to satisfy this requirement.

          # Control Description
            The information system isolates security functions from non-security functions by means of an isolation boundary (implemented via partitions and domains). 
            Such isolation controls access to and protects the integrity of the hardware, software, and firmware that perform those security functions. 
            Information systems implement code separation (i.e., separation of security functions from non-security functions) in a number of ways, including, for example, through the provision of security kernels via processor rings or processor modes. 
            For non-kernel code, security function isolation is often achieved through file system protections that serve to protect the code on disk, and address space protections that protect executing code. 
            Information systems restrict access to security functions through the use of access control mechanisms and by implementing least privilege capabilities. 
            While the ideal is for all of the code within the security function isolation boundary to only contain security-relevant code, it is sometimes necessary to include non-security functions within the isolation boundary as an exception.

          # Control Implementation
            Istio breaks-down services into microservices to isolate security functions from non-security functions.

            Istio alone can not completely satisfy the SC-7 requirement, because Istio sits at Layer 4 and above, in other words it sits atop the IP network you provide it. However, Istio can aid in implementing boundary protection in your stack:
              a. Istio provides monitoring (AU-12) and control of traffic ingress into and egressing out of the cluster, as well as internally for all communication between components. If all information system components are running in the cluster, this satisfies SC-7 a.
              b. Istio operates at layer 4 and above - it cannot implement sub-networks at the IP layer. However, Istio can be used for logical separation of components at runtime (see AC-4 (21)). 
              Istio’s separation should be augmented with network-level separation, e.g. via a CNI plugin, to help implement a defense in depth strategy.
              c. The only ingress into the cluster is via Istio gateways (AC-3), egress is controlled by Istio gateways (AC-4). If all information system components are running in the cluster, this satisfies the needs of SC-7 c. 
              Further, access policy can be applied at both points, as well as at every application instance via Istio’s sidecar. This gives the organization the opportunity to implement more fine-grained controls than is needed by SC-7.

            Like SC-7, Istio works in tandem with a few other components of the infrastructure to satisfy SC-7 (4). 
            For example, it’s common to use an identity-aware proxy (like Platform One’s CNAP), or even a cloud provider load balancer (like an ELB) as the initial interface for an external service, immediately passing the requests on to Istio’s ingress.
            For all of the information system components in the cluster:
              a. Istio provides an interface its ingress and egress gateways for external network traffic. Istio allows configuring how that interface is exposed, including ports and protocols as well as certificates that are served. See AC-4.
              b. Istio provides fine-grained layer 7 policy on each request to control how traffic flows through that ingress. It enforces this policy at ingress gateways to control the external traffic ingress into your information system. 
              Istio also enforces them at egress gateways to control how components of your information system communicate with external systems. See AC-4.
              c. Istio’s ingress gateways serve TLS (or mTLS) to external systems, and Istio provides mTLS between applications of the information system in the mesh. See AC-4.
              d. Istio must be explicitly configured to allow exceptions, either in AuthorizationPolicy documents controlling runtime access or in resource annotations exempting traffic from Istio’s sidecar. 
              These can be used as supporting documents for SC-7 (4) d., but will need to be augmented with organizational documentation citing specific mission needs and durations.
              e. This is an organizational activity out of the scope of Istio.

            At ingress and egress gateways, Istio denies all traffic that does not have explicit traffic routing policies in the form of a VirtualService attached to the gateways. 
            Inside of the mesh, and to control egress out to external services, you can author AuthorizationPolicies to limit access. 
            Those policies must be written in the “allow with positive matching” style.

          # Control Description
            External networks are networks outside of organizational control. 
            A proxy server is a server (i.e., information system or application) that acts as an intermediary for clients requesting information system resources (e.g., files, connections, web pages, or services) from other organizational servers. 
            Client requests established through an initial connection to the proxy server are evaluated to manage complexity and to provide additional protection by limiting direct connectivity. 
            Web content filtering devices are one of the most common proxy servers providing access to the Internet. 
            Proxy servers support logging individual Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) sessions and blocking specific Uniform resource Locators (URLs), domain names, and Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. 
            Web proxies can be configured with organization-defined lists of authorized and unauthorized websites.
            The information system routes organization-defined internal communications traffic to organization-defined external networks through authenticated proxy servers at managed interfaces.

          # Control Implementation
            Istio’s traffic management model relies on the Envoy proxies that are deployed along with the services. 
            All traffic that the mesh services send and receive (data plane traffic) is proxied through Envoy, making it easy to direct and control traffic around the mesh without making any changes to the services.

            Safeguards implemented by organizations to prevent unauthorized exfiltration of information from information systems include, for example; 
              (i) strict adherence to protocol formats; 
              (ii) monitoring for beaconing from information systems; 
              (iii) monitoring for steganography; 
              (iv) disconnecting external network interfaces except when explicitly needed; 
              (v) disassembling and reassembling packet headers; and 
              (vi) employing traffic profile analysis to detect deviations from the volume/types of traffic expected within organizations or call backs to command and control centers. 
            Devices enforcing strict adherence to protocol formats include, for example, deep packet inspection firewalls and XML gateways. 
            These devices verify adherence to protocol formats and specification at the application layer and serve to identify vulnerabilities that cannot be detected by devices operating at the network or transport layers. 
            This control enhancement is closely associated with cross-domain solutions and system guards enforcing information flow requirements.
            The organization prevents the unauthorized exfiltration of information across managed interfaces.

          # Control Implementation
            Istio can set an alert to detect attempted data exfiltration by a service in the cluster. In this mode, Prometheus can tell you both the source and (attempted) destination workload for the blocked request.
            The Istio System manages the ingress and egress network traffic permitted within your OPA-integrated Istio service mesh. 
            You can specify egress traffic is only allowed to a predefined collection of endpoints to minimize the risk of data exfiltration or to implement microservice API authorization.
        remarks: This control is partially implemented by this tool.

          # Control Description
            The capability to dynamically isolate or segregate certain internal components of organizational information systems is useful when it is necessary to partition or separate certain components of dubious origin from those components possessing greater trustworthiness. 
            Component isolation reduces the attack surface of organizational information systems. Isolation of selected information system components is also a means of limiting the damage from successful cyber attacks when those attacks occur.
            The information system provides the capability to dynamically isolate/segregate organization-defined information system components from other components of the system.

          # Control Implementation
            Locality-weighted load balancing allows administrators to control the distribution of traffic to endpoints based on the localities of where the traffic originates and where it will terminate. 
            These localities are specified using arbitrary labels that designate a hierarchy of localities in {region}/{zone}/{sub-zone} form.
            If the goal of the operator is not to distribute load across zones and regions but rather to restrict the regionality of failover to meet other operational requirements an operator can set a ‘failover’ policy instead of a ‘distribute’ policy.

          # Control Description
            Organizations can isolate information system components performing different missions and/or business functions. 
            Such isolation limits unauthorized information flows among system components and also provides the opportunity to deploy greater levels of protection for selected components. 
            Separating system components with boundary protection mechanisms provides the capability for increased protection of individual components and to more effectively control information flows between those components. 
            This type of enhanced protection limits the potential harm from cyber attacks and errors. The degree of separation provided varies depending upon the mechanisms chosen. 
            Boundary protection mechanisms include, for example, routers, gateways, and firewalls separating system components into physically separate networks or sub-networks, cross-domain devices separating subnetworks, virtualization techniques, and encrypting information flows among system components using distinct encryption keys.
            The organization employs boundary protection mechanisms to separate organization-defined information system components supporting organization-defined missions and/or business functions.

          # Control Implementation
            Multi-mesh deployments facilitate division of a system into subsystems with different security and compliance requirements, and facilitate the boundary protection. 
            You put each subsystem into a separate service mesh, preferably on a separate network. You connect the Istio meshes using gateways. The gateways monitor and control cross-mesh traffic at the boundary of each mesh.
            Istio isolation boundaries can run multiple TSB-managed Istio environments within a Kubernetes cluster, or spanning several clusters. 
            These Istio environments are isolated from each other in terms of service discovery and config distribution.

            Prohibit the direct connection of organization-defined unclassified national security system to an external network without the use of organization-defined boundary protection device.

          # Control Implementation
            All outbound traffic from an Istio-enabled pod is redirected to its sidecar proxy by default, accessibility of URLs outside of the cluster depends on the configuration of the proxy. 
            By default, Istio configures the Envoy proxy to pass through requests for unknown services. Although this provides a convenient way to get started with Istio, configuring stricter control is usually preferable.
            Egress gateways can limit how traffic flows to external services outside of the information system under control.
            Istio can be configured to extract end-user credentials from requests for authentication (either locally, or forwarding them on to an external authorization service), and to disallow requests without authentication tokens.

          # Control Description
            Encrypting information for transmission protects information from unauthorized disclosure and modification. 
            Cryptographic mechanisms implemented to protect information integrity include, for example, cryptographic hash functions which have common application in digital signatures, checksums, and message authentication codes. 
            Alternative physical security safeguards include, for example, protected distribution systems.
            The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information; detect changes to information during transmission unless otherwise protected by organization-defined alternative physical safeguards.

          # Control Description
            Information systems can maintain separate execution domains for each executing process by assigning each process a separate address space. 
            Each information system process has a distinct address space so that communication between processes is performed in a manner controlled through the security functions, and one process cannot modify the executing code of another process. 
            Maintaining separate execution domains for executing processes can be achieved, for example, by implementing separate address spaces. 
            This capability is available in most commercial operating systems that employ multi-state processor technologies.

          # Control Implementation
            Istio’s authorization features provide mesh-, namespace-, and workload-wide access control for your workloads in the mesh.
            Istio supports trust domain migration for authorization policy. This means if an Istio mesh needs to change its trust domain, the authorization policy doesn’t need to be changed manually.
