          # Control Description
            Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by authorized users, or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised information system accounts, is a serious and ongoing concern and can have significant adverse impacts on organizations. 
            Auditing the use of privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse, and in doing so, help mitigate the risk from insider threats and the advanced persistent threat (APT).

          # Control Implementation
            Privileged events, including updating the deployment of an application, or use of privileged containers are collected as logs by Loki and displayed by Grafana.

          # Control Description
            An event is any observable occurrence in an organizational information system. 
            Organizations identify audit events as those events which are significant and relevant to the security of information systems and the environments in which those systems operate in order to meet specific and ongoing audit needs. 
            Audit events can include, for example, password changes, failed logons, or failed accesses related to information systems, administrative privilege usage, PIV credential usage, or third-party credential usage. 
            In determining the set of auditable events, organizations consider the auditing appropriate for each of the security controls to be implemented. 
            To balance auditing requirements with other information system needs, this control also requires identifying that subset of auditable events that are audited at a given point in time.

          # Control Implementation
            API endpoints suitable for capturing application level metrics are present on each of the supported applications running as containers.
            In addition, system and cluster level metrics are emitted by containers with read only access to host level information.
            Metrics are captured and stored by Prometheus, an web server capable of scraping endpoints formatted in the appropriate dimensional data format.
            Metrics information is stored on disk in a time series data base, and later queried through a separate component providing a web interface for the query language: PromQL.
            Metrics data can be displayed through a Grafana dashboard for visualization.

          # Control Description
            Alerts provide organizations with urgent messages. Real-time alerts provide these messages at information technology speed (i.e., the time from event detection to alert occurs in seconds or less).
            The information system provides an alert in organization-defined real-time period to organization-defined personnel, roles, and/or locations when the following audit failure events occur organization-defined audit failure events requiring real-time alerts.

          # Control Implementation
            Alertmanager has pre-build alerts for failed pods that would show when ClusterAuditor is not processing events, or prometheus is unable to scrape events.
            Prometheus also has a deadman's alert to ensure end users are seeing events from prometheus as part of its configuration.
            Data can be displayed through a Grafana dashboard for visualization.

          # Control Description
            This control enhancement does not require vulnerability scanning, the generation of performance data, or information system monitoring. 
            Rather, the enhancement requires that the analysis of information being otherwise produced in these areas is integrated with the analysis of audit information. 
            Security Event and Information Management System tools can facilitate audit record aggregation/consolidation from multiple information system components as well as audit record correlation and analysis. 
            The use of standardized audit record analysis scripts developed by organizations (with localized script adjustments, as necessary) provides more cost-effective approaches for analyzing audit record information collected. 
            The correlation of audit record information with vulnerability scanning information is important in determining the veracity of vulnerability scans and correlating attack detection events with scanning results. 
            Correlation with performance data can help uncover denial of service attacks or cyber attacks resulting in unauthorized use of resources. 
            Correlation with system monitoring information can assist in uncovering attacks and in better relating audit information to operational situations.
            The organization integrates analysis of audit records with analysis of vulnerability scanning information; performance data; information system monitoring information; organization-defined data/information collected from other sources to further enhance the ability to identify inappropriate or unusual activity.

          # Control Implementation
            Cluster Auditor's audit data is consolidated with system monitoring tooling (node exporters) for consolidated view to enhance inappropriate or unusual activity.
            Metrics data can be displayed through a Grafana dashboard for visualization.

          # Control Description
            The correlation of physical audit information and audit logs from information systems may assist organizations in identifying examples of suspicious behavior or supporting evidence of such behavior. 
            For example, the correlation of an individual's identity for logical access to certain information systems with the additional physical security information that the individual was actually present at the facility when the logical access occurred, may prove to be useful in investigations.
            The organization correlates information from audit records with information obtained from monitoring physical access to further enhance the ability to identify suspicious, inappropriate, unusual, or malevolent activity.

          # Control Implementation
            Cluster Auditor data in prometheus would enable this, but would require prometheus to also obtain access to physical metrics.

          # Control Description
            Audit reduction is a process that manipulates collected audit information and organizes such information in a summary format that is more meaningful to analysts. 
            Audit reduction and report generation capabilities do not always emanate from the same information system or from the same organizational entities conducting auditing activities. 
            Audit reduction capability can include, for example, modern data mining techniques with advanced data filters to identify anomalous behavior in audit records. 
            The report generation capability provided by the information system can generate customizable reports. 
            Time ordering of audit records can be a significant issue if the granularity of the timestamp in the record is insufficient.

          # Control Implementation
            Grafana is configured with a pre-built dashboard for policy violations that displays data collected by Cluster Auditor.

          # Control Description
            Time stamps generated by the information system include date and time. 
            Time is commonly expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC. 
            Granularity of time measurements refers to the degree of synchronization between information system clocks and reference clocks, for example, clocks synchronizing within hundreds of milliseconds or within tens of milliseconds. 

          # Control Implementation
            Prometheus stores all data as time-series data, so the timestamps of when those violations were present is part of the data-stream.
            Metrics data can be displayed through a Grafana dashboard for visualization.

          # Control Description
            Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit settings, and audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system activity. 
            This control focuses on technical protection of audit information. 
            Physical protection of audit information is addressed by media protection controls and physical and environmental protection controls.

          # Control Implementation
            Grafana has the ability to provide Role Based Access Control to limit the data sources that end users can view by leveraging an
            identity provider. Grafana can also limit users to subsets of metrics within a datasource by the use of Label Based Access Control
            when using Grafana Enterprise.

          # Control Description
            This control enhancement helps to ensure that a compromise of the information system being audited does not also result in a compromise of the audit records.
            The information system backs up audit records organization-defined frequency onto a physically different system or system component than the system or component being audited.

          # Control Implementation
            Prometheus can scrape external components outside of the system, but this configuration is not easily supported as part of
            the current big bang configuration of ClusterAuditor since external access to ClusterAuditor metrics is not exposed via Istio.
            Metrics data can be displayed through a Grafana dashboard for visualization.

          # Control Description
            Individuals with privileged access to an information system and who are also the subject of an audit by that system, may affect the reliability of audit information by inhibiting audit activities or modifying audit records. 
            This control enhancement requires that privileged access be further defined between audit-related privileges and other privileges, thus limiting the users with audit-related privileges.
            The organization authorizes access to management of audit functionality to only organization-defined subset of privileged users.

          # Control Description
            Audit trails are time-correlated if the time stamps in the individual audit records can be reliably related to the time stamps in other audit records to achieve a time ordering of the records within organizational tolerances.
            The information system compiles audit records from organization-defined information system components into a system-wide (logical or physical) audit trail that is time-correlated to within organization-defined level of tolerance for relationship between time stamps of individual records in the audit trail.
          
          # Control Implementation
            Compatible metrics endpoints emitted from each application is compiled by Prometheus and displayed through Grafana with associated timestamps
            of when the data was collected.
