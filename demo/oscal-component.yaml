        description: "# Control Description\n  Access control policies (e.g., identity-based
          policies, role-based policies, control matrices, cryptography) control access
          between active entities or subjects (i.e., users or processes acting on
          behalf of users) and passive entities or objects (e.g., devices, files,
          records, domains) in information systems. \n  In addition to enforcing authorized
          access at the information system level and recognizing that information
          systems can host many applications and services in support of organizational
          missions and business operations, access enforcement mechanisms can also
          be employed at the application and service level to provide increased information
          security.\n\n# Control Implementation\n  Istio implements with global configuration.\n\n#
          How Istio Helps\n  Istio helps implement access enforcement in two ways:
          limiting service-to-service access (see AC-4 below),\n  and acting as an
          enforcement point for end user authentication and authorization (AC-3, this
          section).\n  - Service to Service Access: Istio provides authenticatable
          runtime identities for all applications in the mesh in the form of X.509
          certificates.\n  Those certificates are used for encryption in transit as
          well as authentication of the service's identity.\n  This authenticated
          principal can be used for access control of service to service communication
          via Istio's AuthorizationPolicy.\n  We cover this in detail in AC-4, Information
          Flow Enforcement, below.\n  - End User Authentication and Authorization:
          Istio facilitates end user authentication and authorization in two ways:\n
          \ 1. Istio has native support for JWT authentication and authorization based
          on JWT claims.\n     It can be configured to extract a JWT from each request's
          headers, validate them against issuers and with specific keys, and limit
          access based on any of the JWT's fields.\n  2. Istio supports extracting
          metadata from each request and forwarding it to an external authentication
          and authorization server.\n     Istio will enforce the verdict returned
          by this server, and can attach additional metadata returned by the server
          (e.g., an internal JWT in place of an external API key). "

        description: "# Control Description\n  Information flow control regulates
          where information is allowed to travel within an information system and
          between information systems (as opposed to who is allowed to access the
          information) and without explicit regard to subsequent accesses to that
          information. \n  Flow control restrictions include, for example, keeping
          export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the
          Internet, blocking outside traffic that claims to be from within the organization,
          restricting web requests to the Internet that are not from the internal
          web proxy server, and limiting information transfers between organizations
          based on data structures and content. \n\n# Control Implementation\n  Istio
          implements with mission team configuration.\n\n# How does Istio help?\n
          \ Istio encrypts all in-mesh communication at runtime using the service's
          identity. \n  This provides TLS for all applications in the mesh. If you're
          using the Tetrate Istio Distribution, then this TLS is FIPS verified. mTLS
          is configured through the PeerAuthentication resource, and should be set
          to STRICT to enforce mTLS between all components of the information system.\n
          \ Istio's AuthorizationPolicy controls service-to-service communication
          within the mesh. \n  Combined with Istio ingress and egress gateways, as
          well as a few installation settings, Istio can manage all traffic into and
          out of your deployment.\n  In addition to AuthorizationPolicies controlling
          traffic in the mesh, Istio ingress gateways terminate HTTPS on behalf of
          applications in the mesh (AC-4 (4) - not required by moderate but valuable
          nonetheless). \n  By managing how traffic flows out of applications using
          VirtualServices or ServiceEntries, all traffic leaving your infrastructure
          can be channeled through an egress gateway. \n  Egress gateways can audit
          and limit how traffic flows to external services outside of the information
          system under control."

          (see AC-4 (21)). \n    Istio’s separation should be augmented with network-level

          common to use an identity-aware proxy (like Platform One’s CNAP), or even
          a cloud provider load balancer (like an ELB) as the initial interface for
          an external service, immediately passing the requests on to Istio’s ingress.\n
          \ For all of the information system components in the cluster:\n    a. Istio
          provides an interface its ingress and egress gateways for external network
          traffic. Istio allows configuring how that interface is exposed, including
          ports and protocols as well as certificates that are served. See AC-4.\n
          \   b. Istio provides fine-grained layer 7 policy on each request to control
          how traffic flows through that ingress. It enforces this policy at ingress
          gateways to control the external traffic ingress into your information system.
          \n    Istio also enforces them at egress gateways to control how components
          of your information system communicate with external systems. See AC-4.\n
          \   c. Istio’s ingress gateways serve TLS (or mTLS) to external systems,
          and Istio provides mTLS between applications of the information system in
          the mesh. See AC-4.\n    d. Istio must be explicitly configured to allow
          exceptions, either in AuthorizationPolicy documents controlling runtime
          access or in resource annotations exempting traffic from Istio’s sidecar.
          \n    These can be used as supporting documents for SC-7 (4) d., but will

          egress gateways, Istio denies all traffic that does not have explicit traffic
          routing policies in the form of a VirtualService attached to the gateways.
          \n  Inside of the mesh, and to control egress out to external services,
          you can author AuthorizationPolicies to limit access. \n  Those policies
          must be written in the “allow with positive matching” style. \n  Together,
          Istio implements the SC-7 (5) control on behalf of applications in the mesh."

          # Control Description
            Alerts provide organizations with urgent messages. Real-time alerts provide these messages at information technology speed (i.e., the time from event detection to alert occurs in seconds or less).
            The information system provides an alert in organization-defined real-time period to organization-defined personnel, roles, and/or locations when the following audit failure events occur organization-defined audit failure events requiring real-time alerts.

          # Control Implementation
            Alertmanager has pre-build alerts for failed pods that would show when ClusterAuditor is not processing events, or prometheus is unable to scrape events.
            Prometheus also has a deadman's alert to ensure end users are seeing events from prometheus as part of its configuration.
            Data can be displayed through a Grafana dashboard for visualization.

            Metrics data can be displayed through a Grafana dashboard for visualization.

          # Control Description
            Organization-wide situational awareness includes awareness across all three tiers of risk management (i.e., organizational, mission/business process, and information system) and supports cross-organization awareness.
            The organization analyzes and correlates audit records across different repositories to gain organization-wide situational awareness.

          # Control Implementation
            Aggregating cluster auditor events across multiple sources (clusters) is possible with a multi-cluster deployment of prometheus/grafana.

          vulnerability scanning, the generation of performance data, or information
          system monitoring. \n  Rather, the enhancement requires that the analysis
          of information being otherwise produced in these areas is integrated with
          the analysis of audit information. \n  Security Event and Information Management
          System tools can facilitate audit record aggregation/consolidation from
          multiple information system components as well as audit record correlation
          and analysis. \n  The use of standardized audit record analysis scripts
          developed by organizations (with localized script adjustments, as necessary)
          provides more cost-effective approaches for analyzing audit record information
          collected. \n  The correlation of audit record information with vulnerability
          scanning information is important in determining the veracity of vulnerability
          scans and correlating attack detection events with scanning results. \n
          \ Correlation with performance data can help uncover denial of service attacks
          or cyber attacks resulting in unauthorized use of resources. \n  Correlation
          with system monitoring information can assist in uncovering attacks and
          in better relating audit information to operational situations.\n  The organization

          information; performance data; information system monitoring information;

            Audit trails are time-correlated if the time stamps in the individual audit records can be reliably related to the time stamps in other audit records to achieve a time ordering of the records within organizational tolerances.

          due to the fact that promtail does not actively identify what "priviledged
          functions" would be - it simply scapes all logs from the targets it is instrumented
          to tail.

        description: "# Control Description\n  An event is any observable occurrence
          in an organizational information system. \n  Organizations identify audit
          events as those events which are significant and relevant to the security
          of information systems and the environments in which those systems operate
          in order to meet specific and ongoing audit needs. \n  Audit events can
          include, for example, password changes, failed logons, or failed accesses
          related to information systems, administrative privilege usage, PIV credential
          usage, or third-party credential usage. \n  In determining the set of auditable
          events, organizations consider the auditing appropriate for each of the
          security controls to be implemented. \n  To balance auditing requirements
          with other information system needs, this control also requires identifying
          that subset of auditable events that are audited at a given point in time.\n\n#
          Control Implementation\n  a. Identify the types of events that the system
          is capable of logging in support of the audit function for organization-defined
          event types that the system is capable of logging;\n  b. Coordinate the
          event logging function with other organizational entities requiring audit-related
          information to guide and inform the selection criteria for events to be
          logged;\n  c. Specify the following event types for logging within the system
          organization-defined event types (subset of the event types defined in AU-2a.)
          along with the frequency of (or situation requiring) logging for each identified
          event type;\n  d. Provide a rationale for why the event types selected for
          logging are deemed to be adequate to support after-the-fact investigations
          of incidents; and\n  e. Review and update the event types selected for logging
          on an organization-defined frequency.\n\n  Logging daemons are present on
          each node that BigBang is installed on.  Out of the box, the following events
          are captured:\n  * all containers emitting to STDOUT or STDERR (captured
          \ by container runtime translating container logs to /var/log/containers).\n
          \ * all kubernetes api server requests.\n  * all events emitted by the kubelet.\n\n#

        description: "# Control Description\n  Time stamps generated by the information
          system include date and time. \n  Time is commonly expressed in Coordinated
          Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT),
          or local time with an offset from UTC. \n  Granularity of time measurements
          refers to the degree of synchronization between information system clocks
          and reference clocks, for example, clocks synchronizing within hundreds
          of milliseconds or within tens of milliseconds. \n  Organizations may define
          different time granularities for different system components. \n  Time service
          can also be critical to other security capabilities such as access control
          and identification and authentication, depending on the nature of the mechanisms
          used to support those capabilities.\n\n# Control Implementation\n  Records
          captured by the logging daemon are enriched to  ensure the following are
          always present:\n  * time of the event (UTC).\n  * source of event (pod,
          namespace, container id).\n  Applications are responsible for providing
          all other information.\n  Validating `logfmt` as the config.logFormat would
          be the goal. This is currently a secret mounted to /etc/promtail/promtail.yaml
